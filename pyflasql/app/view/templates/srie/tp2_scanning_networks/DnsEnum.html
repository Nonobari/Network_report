            DNSenum is a widely used Perl script that provides comprehensive DNS enumeration capabilities for a domain, including discovering non-contiguous IP blocks. 
            It employs multithreading to efficiently gather DNS information, such as DNS servers, hostnames, subdomains, DNS record types, zone transfers, and more. 
            DNSenum is known for its speed and effectiveness in automating DNS reconnaissance tasks, making it a popular tool among network administrators, penetration testers, and cybersecurity professionals. 
            It provides valuable information for network mapping, vulnerability assessment, and security auditing, aiding in identifying potential security weaknesses in a domain's DNS infrastructure.
